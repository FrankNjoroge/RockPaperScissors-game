        <strong>Rock Paper Scissors</strong> is a two player game. Each player
        chooses one of rock, paper or scissors, without knowing the other
        player's choice. The winner is decided by a set of rules:

      <ul>
        <li>Rock beats scissors</li>
        <li>Scissors beat paper</li>
        <li>Paper beats rock</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If both players choose the same, there is no winner for that round. For
        this game, the computer will be one of the players.You get 5 trials to
        finish the game. To play again, click the play again button.
